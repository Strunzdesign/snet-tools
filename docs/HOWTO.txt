This file gives some examples how to use the collection of tools to be used together with the HDLCd:
---
Most of these tools require three arguments, some four:
1.) The IP address of the host with the HDLCd entity running,
2.) the TCP port number of the respective HDLCd entity,
3.) a device string that indicated which serial port has to be opened.
4.) Some tools allow a forth parameter to provide an s-net short address DestSSA.

Example (GNU/Linux):

cd build/src/tools/snet-dissector
./snet-dissector 127.0.0.1 10000 /dev/ttyUSB0

Example (Microsoft Windows):

cd build\src\tools\snet-dissector
snet-dissector.exe 127.0.0.1 10000 "//./COM1"
