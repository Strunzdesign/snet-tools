How to install the s-net(r) tools for the HDLC Daemon
===

For GNU/Linux:
---
Preparations:
- Install the "GCC toolchain"
- Install the "Boost Libraries"
- Install the "CMake" build system
- Install the shared header files from https://github.com/Strunzdesign/hdlcd-devel.git
- Install the shared header files from https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-devel.git

To compile and install the s-net(r) tools, just follow these steps:
1.) git clone https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-tools.git
2.) cd snet-tools
3.) mkdir build
4.) cd build
5.) cmake ..
6.) make
7.) make install (as root)

All binaries will be installed to "/usr/local/bin/".



For Microsoft Windows 7:
---
Preparations:
- Download the latest "nuwen MinGW" distribution from https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
- Assure that you pick a MinGW distribution that already includes "Git" and the "Boost Libraries"
- Follow the installation guide, e.g., unpack MinGW to C:\MinGW
- Add MinGW to the path according to the installation guide
- Download and install "CMake" from https://cmake.org/download
- Install the shared header files from https://github.com/Strunzdesign/hdlcd-devel.git
- Install the shared header files from https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-devel.git

To compile and install the s-net(r) tools, just follow these steps:
1.) Go to your projects' folder and open a shell there
2.) git clone https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-tools.git
3.) cd snet-tools
4.) mkdir build
5.) cd build
6.) Pick yourself a directory to install the compiled files, e.g., consider C:\snet-tools
7.) Remember the directory where you installed the shared header files, e.g., C:\hdlcd-devel
8.) Remember the directory where you installed the shared header files, e.g., C:\snet-devel
10.) cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/c/snet-tools -DHDLCD_DEVEL_INCLUDE_DIR=/c/hdlcd-devel/include -DSNET_DEVEL_INCLUDE_DIR=/c/snet-devel/include ..
11.) If you get an error message on step 10, repeat step 10 once
12.) make
13.) make install

The "snet-tools" binaries will be installed to "C:\snet-tools\bin\".

Have fun :-)
