This repository contains multiple tools for s-net(r) devices to be used together with the HDLC Daemon:

snet-dissector
---
Usage:       snet-dissector --connect SerialPort@IPAddress:PortNbr
Description: Prints out all s-net(r) packets sent to and received from the specified device in
             human-readable form.



snet-flooder
---
Usage:       snet-flooder --connect SerialPort@IPAddress:PortNbr --destination <Hex-SSA>
Description: A stress tester for s-net(r) devices. Sends a flood of packets to the device in order
             to trigger bugs or to play with the congestion control features of s-net(r).



snet-streamtestclient
---
Usage:       snet-streamtestclient --connect SerialPort@IPAddress:PortNbr --destination <Hex-SSA>
Description: This client is the counterpart to the StreamTestService of s-net(r). It sends
             a congestion-controlled flow of probe requests to the node with the specified
             address and evaluates the responses from that node. The created statistics help
             to identify issues with the network and to test the stability.
